# Data Scientist Candidate Challenge

The attached csv (bundesliga.csv) file contains data related to the Bundesliga seasons 09/10 - 16/17, grouped by several variable, such as event name, teams, channel and market.

Use Python, R or any other software you feel comfortable with to answer the following questions. Write a brief report to discuss your findings and include any code / script you write in an appendix.

1. Perform a Exploratory Data Analysis to highlight the main features of the data. Use suitable plots to display some useful aspects of the data set
 * Which are, based on the turnover, our top 5 markets?
 * Which was the match with the highest turnover?

2. Use any AI algorithm to build a predictive model for the Bundesliga season 17/18. Use the results set (result.csv) to predict the turnover (fulfill the empty column). 
 * Discuss the accuracy of your model with some metrics
 * Send us the result.csv file back, so we can calculate the quality of the results.
